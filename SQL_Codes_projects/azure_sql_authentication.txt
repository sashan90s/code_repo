Authentication
Who you are?
If I login, how can I make sure its me logging in?


You can use windows authentication
sql server authentication is using sql user name and password
Other options- entraid or active directory

Three different ways you can authenticate in:
Cloud only - handle sign in completely in the cloud
Federated - existing federate provider- another app to login to entra id
pass through - 

For auth N:
You have to first set up an admin
then login as that admin 
provide access to other user using the following code:

CREATE USER [microsoft@activedirectory.com]
FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER

But user still cant see the tables, views of database. Because they need Authorisation. Auth Z

Auth Z
Authorisation 
What you can see?
What can I see when I login?
What I can access

Add the member to the role
ALTER ROLE [db_owner]
ADD MEMBER [microsoft@activedirectory.com]

REMOVE the member to the role
ALTER ROLE [db_owner]
DROP MEMBER [microsoft@activedirectory.com]

What are the roles available to me?
exec sp_helprole; -- this will give ya the list.

GRANT SELECT ON OBJECT:: [DBO].[TABLEP]
TO [username@microsoft.com]

GRANT - YES 
REMOVE - No
DENY- ABSOLUTELY NO. OVERRIDE ANY PREVIOUS PERMISSION


<Authorisation> <permission> on <securable>::<name> to <principal>




Seeing what your permissions are:
select * from sys.fn_my_permissions(<object name>, <object type>)

select * from sys.fn_my_permissions(DP203, 'Database')


Custome Database Roles:

CREATE ROLE MyCustomerRole1 -- you can also give some else the authorisation by using CREATE ROLE MyCustomerRole1 AUTHORISATION <owner_username>
GRANT SELECT ON OBJECT::[DBO].[TABLE_NAME]
TO MyCustomerRole1
