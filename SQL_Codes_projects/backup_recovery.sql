GRAPHICAL WAY OF DOING THIS: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/tutorial-sql-server-backup-and-restore-to-azure-blob-storage-service?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=SSMS


1. Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure the following:

SQL Server Version: SQL Server 2012 SP1 CU2 or later (required for Azure Blob integration).
Azure Blob Storage Account: Set up a storage account in Azure.
Azure Blob Container: Create a container within your storage account for backups.
SQL Server Permissions: Ensure SQL Server has internet access and appropriate permissions to connect to Azure.
2. Create a Credential for Azure Blob Storage
Generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS):

Go to the Azure Portal, navigate to your storage account.
Select Containers, choose your container, and click on Generate SAS.
Set the permissions (Read, Write, List) and expiration as required.
Copy the SAS token.
Create the Credential in SQL Server: Use the SAS token to create a credential in SQL Server:

CREATE CREDENTIAL [AzureBlobBackupCredential]
WITH IDENTITY = 'Shared Access Signature',
SECRET = 'sas_token';

/* another way (you could also do this graphically)
Example:
USE master
CREATE CREDENTIAL [https://msfttutorial.blob.core.windows.net/containername]
WITH IDENTITY='SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE'
, SECRET = 'sharedaccesssignature'
GO */


Replace sas_token with the actual SAS token string.

3. Plan Your Backup Strategy
A typical strategy includes:

Full Backup: Weekly (e.g., Sunday).
Differential Backup: Daily (e.g., every day except Sunday).
Transaction Log Backup: Hourly or more frequently, based on RTO/RPO needs.
4. Create Backup Scripts
Write T-SQL scripts for each type of backup:

Full Backup
BACKUP DATABASE [YourDatabase]
TO URL = 'https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/YourDatabase_FULL.bak'
WITH CREDENTIAL = 'AzureBlobBackupCredential',
   FORMAT,
   INIT,
   STATS = 10;
Differential Backup
BACKUP DATABASE [YourDatabase]
TO URL = 'https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/YourDatabase_DIFF.bak'
WITH CREDENTIAL = 'AzureBlobBackupCredential',
   DIFFERENTIAL,
   STATS = 10;
Transaction Log Backup
BACKUP LOG [YourDatabase]
TO URL = 'https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/YourDatabase_LOG.trn'
WITH CREDENTIAL = 'AzureBlobBackupCredential',
   STATS = 10;
5. Automate the Backups
Using SQL Server Agent
Create Jobs:

Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
Expand SQL Server Agent > Jobs > New Job.
Create Steps for Each Backup Type:

Add separate job steps for full, differential, and transaction log backups.
Use the T-SQL scripts from Step 4 in each step.
Schedule the Jobs:

Set the schedule for each job:
Full Backup: Weekly.
Differential Backup: Daily.
Transaction Log Backup: Hourly or per requirements.
Example Job Configuration
Job Name: DatabaseBackup
Step 1: Full Backup (Schedule: Weekly).
Step 2: Differential Backup (Schedule: Daily).
Step 3: Transaction Log Backup (Schedule: Hourly).
6. Verify the Backups
After automating the process:

Verify that backups are being created in Azure Blob Storage.
Test restoring from these backups to validate the process.
7. Restore Backups from Azure Blob
Use the following T-SQL commands to restore:

Restore Full Backup
RESTORE DATABASE [YourDatabase]
FROM URL = 'https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/YourDatabase_FULL.bak'
WITH FILE = 1, NORECOVERY, STATS = 10;
Restore Differential Backup
RESTORE DATABASE [YourDatabase]
FROM URL = 'https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/YourDatabase_DIFF.bak'
WITH FILE = 1, NORECOVERY, STATS = 10;
Restore Transaction Log
RESTORE LOG [YourDatabase]
FROM URL = 'https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/YourDatabase_LOG.trn'
WITH FILE = 1, RECOVERY, STATS = 10;
8. Monitoring and Maintenance
Monitor Jobs: Use SQL Server Agent history to monitor job success/failure.
Clean Up Old Backups: Implement a script or lifecycle management policy in Azure to delete old backups.
Review Logs: Check SQL Server logs for any errors or warnings.
9. Consider Third-Party Tools (Optional)
If you need advanced features like compression, encryption, or centralized management, consider tools like:

Redgate SQL Backup
SQL Safe Backup
Azure Backup for SQL Server
This approach ensures your backups are automated, secure, and stored in a cloud environment for disaster recovery. Let me know if you need detailed scripts or further customization! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ”§
